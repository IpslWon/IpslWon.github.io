description: After building the run and coop for my small flock, a year before it was cool, I knew there was data to be had. To monitor and care for my flock, I've created a sytem using a Rasperry Pi and several other hardware pieces. I had several solar panels from when I moved up from California and this was a great use case for offsetting my power consumption. The project started out using a simple temperature sensor and relay, now includes several more sensors and an Edge TPU for image classifcation.

## The Challange
    Taking care of chickens while working full-time as a Sales Engineer means many hours hoping the crow I hear during my Zoom meeting isn't anything important 
and just an egg announcement. Chickens, while hardy, can still suffer from frostbite on their toes and waddle. I wanted to make sure the coop wasn't getting too cold at night while minimizing the fire hazard and automating wherever possible.
