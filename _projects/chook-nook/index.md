description: After building the run and coop for my small flock, a year before it was cool, I knew there was data to be had. To monitor and care for my flock, I've created a sytem using a Rasperry Pi and several other hardware pieces. I had several solar panels from when I moved up from California and this was a great use case for offsetting my power consumption. The project started out using a simple temperature sensor and relay, now includes several more sensors and an <a href="https://www.coral.ai/products/accelerator">Edge TPUk</a> for image classifcation.
